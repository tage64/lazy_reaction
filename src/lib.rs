//! An implementation of a semi-reactive system, similar to
//! [reactive_graph](https://docs.rs/reactive_graph) but much simpler. In particular, unlike
//! reactive_graph, this implementation does not require a global runtime. Instead, updates become
//! visible in [derived signals](DerivedSignal) only after a call to [`ReactiveGraph::tick()`].
//!
//! However, the most notable difference from reactive_graph is that this implementation does not
//! include any side effects such as the `Effect` type. You must manually query nodes in the graph
//! after calling [`tick()`](ReactiveGraph::tick). Consequently, the entire graph does not need to
//! be reevaluated at every tick; only the relevant parts of the graph are updated when you call
//! [`Source::get()`].
//!
//! In short, the system operates as follows:
//!
//! - You create a set of signals using the [`signal()`] function. These act as sources for the
//!   reactive graph and receive values from the outside world. Each signal comes in a pair:
//!   ([`ReadSignal`], [`WriteSignal`]). The [`ReadSignal`] type implements the [`Source`] trait,
//!   which provides the following methods:
//!
//!     - [`Source::get()`]: Returns `Some(val)` if the signal has been updated since the last call
//!       to this method, or [`None`] otherwise. For [`ReadSignal`], it returns [`Some`] on the
//!       first call with the initial value; this is not the case for [`DerivedSignal`] (see below).
//!
//!     - [`Source::get_existing()`]: Returns the current value. This requires that values
//!       implement [`Clone`]. If you are working with large objects, consider wrapping them in a
//!       shared pointer such as [`Arc`].
//!
//! - You create a graph for all derived signals and memos with [`ReactiveGraph::new()`].
//!
//! - You add [derived signals](DerivedSignal) using [`ReactiveGraph::derived_signal()`] or
//!   [`ReactiveGraph::memo()`]. These are nodes that depend on one or more sources within the
//!   reactive graph. The sources may be [pure signals](ReadSignal) or other [derived signals]
//!   (`DerivedSignal`). Any type implementing the [`Source`] trait can serve as a source.
//!
//!     [`DerivedSignal`] also implements the [`Source`] trait, with one notable distinction from
//!     [`ReadSignal`]: the [`get()`-function](Source::get) may return a new value (`Some`) only
//!     after a call to [`ReactiveGraph::tick()`]. Subsequent calls to [`Source::get()`] will return
//!     [`None`] until the next tick. This also applies after its creationâ€”`get()` will return
//!     [`None`] until the first tick.
//!
//! - You update the system by pushing new values to signals using [`WriteSignal::set()`].
//!
//! - When you want to observe changes, you call [`ReactiveGraph::tick()`].
//!
//! - You use [`DerivedSignal::get()`] to retrieve the value of a derived signal. If it returns
//!   [`None`], the value has not changed since you (or another derived signal) last called `get()`.
//!   You can always retrieve the latest value (as of the last tick) with
//!   [`DerivedSignal::get_existing()`], regardless of whether it has changed.
//!
//! So, why is it lazy? Because derived values are only computed on demand. In reactive_graph,
//! derived signals are reevaluated on every tick of the runtime, and relevant side effects are
//! triggered. Here, you decide when and which parts of the graph should be reevaluated. Only when
//! you call [`DerivedSignal::get()`] are the necessary parts of the graph recomputed.
//!
//! ### Example
//!
//! ```
//! use lazy_reaction::{ReactiveGraph, Source, signal};
//!
//! let (mut get_year, set_year) = signal(1989);
//! let (get_month, set_month) = signal(11);
//! let (get_day, set_day) = signal(9);
//!
//! // Initial call to get() will return the values but subsequent will not.
//! assert_eq!(get_year.get(), Some(1989));
//! assert_eq!(get_year.get(), None);
//! assert_eq!(get_year.get(), None);
//! // However get_existing() works.
//! assert_eq!(get_year.get_existing(), 1989);
//! assert_eq!(get_month.get_existing(), 11);
//!
//! // Let's create derived signals that format these items.
//! // We begin by constructing a reactive graph:
//! let rgraph = ReactiveGraph::new();
//!
//! // And then we add the derived signals.
//! // get_year is the source, and is cheaply clonable.
//! let mut formatted_year = rgraph.derived_signal(get_year.clone(), |year| year.to_string());
//!
//! assert_eq!(formatted_year.get(), Some("1989".to_string()));
//! assert_eq!(formatted_year.get(), None);
//! assert_eq!(formatted_year.get_existing(), "1989");
//!
//! // It is usually better to use a memo. Then the value will only be considered updated if it has
//! // changed.
//! let mut formatted_month = rgraph.memo(get_month, |m| format!("{m:02}"));
//! let mut formatted_day = rgraph.memo(get_day, |d| format!("{d:02}"));
//!
//! // Now we show the real power of the system! We agrigate these derived signals to a formatted
//! // date. This will only be reevaluated if any of the input signals changed.
//! let mut formatted_date = rgraph.memo(
//!     (formatted_year, formatted_month, formatted_day),
//!     |(yyyy, mm, dd)| format!("{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}"),
//! );
//!
//! // A value is immediately available based on the get_existing() calls of the sources.
//! assert_eq!(formatted_date.get(), Some("1989-11-09".to_string()));
//! assert_eq!(formatted_date.get(), None);
//!
//! // Let's make a tick of the graph!
//! rgraph.tick();
//!
//! // Nothing has changed so get() still returns None.
//! assert_eq!(formatted_date.get(), None);
//! assert_eq!(formatted_date.get_existing(), "1989-11-09");
//!
//! // Let's change dates.
//! set_year.set(1991);
//! assert_eq!(get_year.get(), Some(1991));
//! set_month.set(12);
//! set_day.set(8);
//! // We haven't called tick() yet so nothing has been updated.
//! assert_eq!(formatted_date.get(), None);
//!
//! rgraph.tick();
//! assert_eq!(formatted_date.get(), Some("1991-12-08".to_string()));
//!
//! set_year.set(2024);
//!
//! rgraph.tick();
//! assert_eq!(formatted_date.get(), Some("2024-12-08".to_string()));
//! ```
